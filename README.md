**Blog website**
The Blog Website developed using the MERN stack provides users with a seamless platform to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences through blog posts. 
The website features user authentication with a register and login page, allowing users to create and manage their personal accounts.

**Blog Management**
Authenticated users can compose and publish new blog posts.
Authors can edit and update their existing blog posts, enabling them to refine and add new information over time.
Authors have the ability to remove blog posts they no longer wish to be visible on the platform.

Users can customize their profiles with a profile picture and update their profile in future.

**Frontend**
The frontend is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
React Router is implemented for seamless navigation between pages without full-page reloads.

**Database**
MongoDB is used as the backend database to store user accounts and blog post data securely.
The Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) facilitates easy interaction with the MongoDB database.

The Express.js framework is employed to handle server-side operations, including user authentication, blog creation, updates, and deletions.
Node.js serves as the runtime environment, ensuring efficient server-side execution.
